# AS Electronics

This is a site build with Jekyll used to track my work for my AS-level electronics course, but it's pretty redundant at the time of writing. We were told to write a short document in one lesson, and I anticipated more to come. Naturally spending a week and a half making this was the right idea.

## Repurposing It

The website would be pretty easy to repurpose for other projects. Basically, create a bunch of markdown documents, and create "categories" by placing them in subdirectories. For instance, `logic-gates.md` is part of the ET1 unit, so I've put it in a "et1" directory. The Jekyll site, when built, will create detailed index pages, listing the contained subdirectories and documents.
